## Table Tap Console

TableTap is a self-ordering service designed for modern restaurants. By scanning a QR code, customers can view the menu, place orders directly from their phones, and have them sent to the kitchen and counter in real time. No downloads, no wait time â€” just seamless ordering and dining.

This console is for kitchen and counter (admin). Kitchen can see orders in real time and update order's status to notify customers. Admin can manage orders, menu items, tables and users.
